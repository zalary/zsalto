<p>For decades, waves of technology hype have crashed onto the shores of business. In the wake lies the dirty work of transformation. Today, every company is in some sense a technology company, and they understand the increasing need to transform through DevOps. Not only can implementing (and practicing) DevOps help companies respond more quickly to customer and market changes, but it also helps organizations achieve the holy grail of increasing value while lowering costs.</p>
<p>But how can companies embrace DevOps principles to tackle the dirty work and achieve desired business outcomes? From culture and strategy to mindset and communications, here are ways leaders can enact change and see real results.</p>
<p>Understand The Effect of culture on DevOps initiatives.</p>
<p>While more enterprises prioritize DevOps, nearly 75% of DevOps initiatives will fail to meet expectations through 2022, according to Gartner predictions. Why?</p>
<p>The answer is culture. Although most organizations say they rely on DevOps to deploy software, Gartner says that “people-related” factors, not technology, inhibit when companies achieve positive results. 88% of the respondents said team culture was among the top three people-related attributes affecting their organization’s ability to scale DevOps.</p>
<p>Before this movement, software development teams did not communicate with the IT and operations teams responsible for deploying applications and services. Rigid, top-down leadership decisions and well-defended, non-collaborative fiefdoms plagued the relationship between these groups, and processes followed a slow, arduous, inflexible waterfall approach.</p>
<p>This lack of communication and visibility is problematic for creating digital experiences. It inevitably leads to contentious relationships as the lack of alignment results in applications that fail to meet customer expectations. Many of today’s developers and engineers have lived in those environments firsthand and can relate to the pain and emotional scars of trying to deliver amidst self-defeating processes.</p>
<p>Define the business outcomes you’re shooting for.</p>
<p>No business initiative can thrive without being rooted in a quantifiable outcome that has an impact and meaning for the organization. CIOs and CTOs understand that DevOps delivers better ROI through improved customer relationships, a better customer experience, increased innovation opportunities and quicker time-to-value—but it all starts with the unifying force of having tangible goals. Where do you want to go and how will you get there?</p>
<p>To achieve a quicker path to DevOps success, business leaders should consider the following:</p>
<p>• Define DevOps for the organization and establish tangible value streams, strategies and tactics that connect to business outcomes. What key results do you want to achieve?</p>
<p>• Do not establish a standalone DevOps team to serve as a singular entity for digital transformation. Instead of eliminating silos, this creates another potential pool of esoteric hierarchy and an unintended group of auditors who will slow progress.</p>
<p>• Ensure that leaders and their teams have a 100% buy-in to DevOps since, to quote Abraham Lincoln, “a house divided against itself cannot stand.” Identify those leaders responsible for enabling change and breaking down barriers.</p>
<p>To succeed, you must set measurable goals. If you want to improve the customer experience, how will you measure that pursuit? Through an increase in customer retention, an improvement in customer satisfaction scores, revenue growth, adoption rates, or the development of new services or products? In short, how will you know when you’ve achieved what you set out to achieve?</p>
<p>KPIs like these probably sound familiar for a reason. Until you have a measurable outcome affixed to an initiative, you will neither be able to measure success nor convey true ROI. By expressing each DevOps initiative in quantified business value, companies can ensure that programs provide a long-term return.</p>
<p>Avoid creating a DevOps team that acts as an umbrella.</p>
<p>DevOps is a cultural concept that aims to shift the philosophy of how a company operates: break down silos, reduce bottlenecks and eliminate redundancies to create an agile organization. In this model, each employee’s attention expands beyond their departments toward a broader perspective that encompasses the business, enabling a more holistic approach that can lead to better customer solutions.</p>
<p>In this sense, creating an “umbrella” DevOps team to navigate multiple teams becomes self-defeating. DevOps requires that people leave their comfort zones and actively collaborate with others outside their team dynamic. With an umbrella group, teams could abdicate responsibility and perpetuate those silos.</p>
<p>Instead, consider leveraging an embedded DevOps engineer or practitioner as a mediator or ombudsman who can navigate different environments and facilitate cross-functional collaboration, all while maintaining the flow and velocity of related work. The mediator can direct teams toward common goals, design shared KPIs and metrics, and organize routine syncs and status updates so everyone is aware of the work outside of their function.</p>
<p>Be patient and commit to the dirty work of digital transformation.</p>
<p>Today’s tech and business landscape demand fluid and deliberate change. You cannot implement DevOps overnight, but when you take stock of how fast technology moves and how ubiquitous its impacts on the business have become, DevOps is worth the time and investment. To date, and even more acutely since the pandemic has altered traditional ways of working, DevOps has become one of the most productive frameworks for empowering employees, delivering incremental change more holistically and building a culture that inspires everyone.</p>
<p>As innovation and disruptions will always be on the horizon, leaders should approach DevOps as a methodology and a mindset for success—not a lifesaver to eliminate organizational problems. By knowing where you want to go and what success looks like, adapting a working strategy of open communication and collaboration internally, and committing to the dirty work of digital transformation, leaders can break down silos, foster an agile culture and accelerate business growth.</p>
