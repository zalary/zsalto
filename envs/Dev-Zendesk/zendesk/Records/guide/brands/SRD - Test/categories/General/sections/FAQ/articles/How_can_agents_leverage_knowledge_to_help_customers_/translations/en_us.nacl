<p>You can use our <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012706488" target="_blank">Knowledge Capture app</a> to leverage your team’s collective knowledge.</p>
<p>Using the app, agents can:
</p><ul>
  <li>Search the Help Center without leaving the ticket</li>
  <li>Insert links to relevant Help Center articles in ticket comments</li>
  <li>Add inline feedback to existing articles that need updates</li>
  <li>Create new articles while answering tickets using a pre-defined template</li>
</ul>


<p>Agents never have to leave the ticket interface to share, flag, or create knowledge, so they can help the customer, while also improving your self-service offerings for other customers.</p>

<p>To get started, see our <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001975088" target="_blank">Knowledge Capture documentation</a>.</p>

<p>And before your agents can start creating new knowledge directly from tickets, you’ll need to <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002374987" target="_blank">create a template</a> for them to use. To help you along, we’ve provided some template ideas below. You can copy and paste any sample template below into a new article, add the <strong>KCTemplate</strong> label to the article, and you’ll be all set.</p>
